Hello! My name is Zach Hammann, and I am currently a Senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am also a student in the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management. I'm studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics, and I am getting a minor in Business. I'm very passionate about working with data, and find myself drawn to projects that require outside-the-box thinking, critical problem solving, and healthy communication and teamwork.  
  
I've completed three internships throughout my college experience, and have enjoyed my time working on data focused projects and problems. 
  
Please contact me with any questions. My contact information is located under the **cv** section of the website, but you can also find my email at the bottom of this page. Thank you for visiting!
