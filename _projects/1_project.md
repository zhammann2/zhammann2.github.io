The Survey Analysis App was a project completed at Kiewit during the summer of 2024, when I was working as a Data Services Intern for the Kiewit Data Services department. In company customers needed a product that would allow them to analyze large swaths of free text responses to various surveys without spending vast amounts of time and introducing human bias.

    Several different technologies were used during the development of the Survey App. Notable technologies included using Python and Flask as a backend, Hugging Face for sourcing different large language models, and LangChain for formatting data and functionality regarding large language model interactions.

The final product that was developed included a Python/Flask app in order to handle more computationally expensive operations, paired with a Python/Gradio app to provide a dynamic and aesthetic interface for users. Some of the interesting packages/technologies that I was able to work with and learn about included Gradio, Flask, LangChain, and Hugging Face. I also got to learn about several different patterns incuding a RAG pipeline, Flask API, and techology integration.

For any inquiries about my experience with this project or any of the technologies that were used, please contact me via email.
