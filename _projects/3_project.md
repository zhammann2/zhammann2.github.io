This website has been a personal project that has focused on understanding different web frameworks and how to host a website. I've leveraged several different free services and templates, and I'd love to share a little bit about how this website came to be. This site is still a work in progress, and I'll be updating it with new experiences and projects I have the privelege of experiencing.

Firstly, this website is hosted with Github Pages. Github will host one static website for free for each user, and I highly recommend using this service. It is easy to setup, deploys automatically to a github.io URL, and eliminates the cost requirement that can be a common barrier to many looking for a way to have their own website. I'll provide links to all the different sources that I discuss at the bottom of this page.

Secondly, I have used an open source template to help implement much of the functionality present. Named al-folio, it can be easily found on github and has a nifty "Use as template" option when it comes to mirroring the functionality. I'll also link the repository below. It contains a vast amount of information about development, customization, installation, and even has an FAQ section.

Finally, this website uses Jekyll, a ruby gem, to generate static web pages. I used it as it has incredibly simple integration with Github Pages and it can leverage several different packages to create functionality that would otherwise require more robust web development skills.
