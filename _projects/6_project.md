This project was a semester long group project focused on Web Development for my Software Engineering IV course.

Many classroom polling apps are expensive, somewhat clunky, and are often missing key features that teachers and professors want. As an introductory project into web development, our group used a React-JavaScript front end, an Express server to manage our session functionality, and a Google Firebase data store to hold login information and created questions.

    There are many polling apps to choose from, so we chose to design a very lightweight application that can start and end sessions with ease.

To create our first web development project, we chose to utilize React-JS with a Google Firebase service to handle authentication and data storage. The app was a sucess, with multiple people being able to join sessions and answer question posed by the host. We also implemented different functionalities for users with teacher vs student credentials. Deployment was not within the scope for this project, but would also have been available as a Firebase service.
