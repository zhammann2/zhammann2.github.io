This project was completed for Farm Credit Services of America, working though Raikes School Design Studio.

In order to help farmers and ranchers with the machinery research process, the Design Studio team created a product known as Machinery Match.
Machinery Match is a website that allows users to select any two tractors and get a detailed comparison of the two pieces of machinery.
Using IronGuides as a data source, the page allows users to select tractors by filtering Brand, Model, and Year. IronGuides provides a wealth of options,
and includes nearly all modern equipment as well as lots of older machinery.

    The team worked closely with AgDirect, FCSA's machinery oriented partner. The product utilized Azure's OpenAI models in order to provide custom comparisons between tractors.

After two tractors are selected, the team utilized Azure's OpenAI models in order to create a detailed and customized comparison between the tractors.
In addition to the comparison section, highlights were provided for both pieces of equipment. A full specification table for both tractors is also provided at the bottom of the page.

The product was created with an Angular-Typescript front end, with a backend server running with Node. If you have any questons regarding my experience with the project, please contact me via email.
